Below are the steps for running the applicaion:

- Extract the application. (you will find two folders inside 'client' and 'server')
- Open command prompt inside 'server' folder and type 'npm install' to install the dependencies.
  After the installation finishes type 'npm start'. This will start the server side of application on
  port '3000'.
- Similarly open another command prompt inside 'client' folder and type 'npm install' to install the 
  dependencies and when installation finishes type 'npm start'. This will start the angular/client
  side of the application on port '4200'.
